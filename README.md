# python-api-challenge

## Requirements
* [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [citipy](https://github.com/wingchen/citipy) Python package

APIs are very useful in gathering data for an analysis. Here, I use the OpenWeatherMap API to gather data to visualize some weather metrics against the latitude of a randomly generated list of 500+ cities. The following relationships are presented:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

A CSV file containing all data retrieved as well as PNG images for each plot created are also included.
